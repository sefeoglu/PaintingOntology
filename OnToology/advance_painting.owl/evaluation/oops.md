The following evaluation results have been generated by the [RESTFul web service](http://oops-ws.oeg-upm.net/) provided by [OOPS!](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!).

It is obvious that not all the pitfalls are equally important; their impact in the ontology will depend on multiple factors. For this reason, each pitfall has an importance level attached indicating how important it is. We have identified three levels:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/critical.png" height="15px"> It is crucial to correct the pitfall. Otherwise, it could affect the ontology consistency, reasoning, applicability, etc.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> Though not critical for ontology function, it is important to correct this type of pitfall.

## Pitfalls



#### P22. Using different naming conventions in the ontology <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The ontology elements are not named following the same convention (for example CamelCase or use of delimiters as &quot;-&quot; or &quot;_&quot;) . Some notions about naming conventions are provided in [2].*

    

#### P04. Creating unconnected ontology elements <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (8 cases detected).
*Ontology elements (classes, object properties and datatype properties) are created isolated, with no relation to the rest of the ontology.*

    

#### P07. Merging different concepts in the same class <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*A class whose name refers to two or more different concepts is created.*

    

#### P08. Missing annotations <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (312 cases detected).
*This pitfall consists in creating an ontology element and failing to provide human readable annotations attached to it. Consequently, ontology elements lack annotation properties that label them (e.g. rdfs:label, lemon:LexicalEntry, skos:prefLabel or skos:altLabel) or that define them (e.g. rdfs:comment or dc:description). This pitfall is related to the guidelines provided in [5].*

    

#### P02. Creating synonyms as classes <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*Several classes whose identifiers are synonyms are created and defined as equivalent (owl:equivalentClass) in the same namespace. This pitfall is related to the guidelines presented in [2], which explain that synonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes.*

    

#### P12. Equivalent properties not explicitly declared <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (37 cases detected).
*The ontology lacks information about equivalent properties (owl:equivalentProperty) in the cases of duplicated relationships and/or attributes.*

    

#### P24. Using recursive definitions <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*An ontology element (a class, an object property or a datatype property) is used in its own definition. Some examples of this would be: (a) the definition of a class as the enumeration of several classes including itself;  (b) the appearance of a class within its owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf axioms; (c) the appearance of an object property in its rdfs:domain or range rdfs:range definitions; or (d) the appearance of a datatype property in its rdfs:domain definition.*

    

#### P20. Misusing ontology annotations <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The contents of some annotation properties are swapped or misused. This pitfall might affect annotation properties related to natural language information (for example, annotations for naming such as rdfs:label or for providing descriptions such as rdfs:comment). Other types of annotation could also be affected as temporal, versioning information, among others.*

    

#### SUGGESTION: symmetric or transitive object properties.. symmetric or transitive object properties. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (53 cases detected).
*The domain and range axioms are equal for each of the following object properties. Could they be symmetric or transitive?*

    

#### P11. Missing domain or range in properties <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (480 cases detected).
*Object and/or datatype properties without domain or range (or none of them) are included in the ontology.*

    

#### P13. Inverse relationships not explicitly declared <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (526 cases detected).
*This pitfall appears when any relationship (except for those that are defined as symmetric properties using owl:SymmetricProperty) does not have an inverse relationship (owl:inverseOf) defined within the ontology.*
